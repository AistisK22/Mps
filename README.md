<b>Nutrition planning system MPS</b>

The developed nutrition planning system is intended for individuals who want to monitor their health indicators more closely by tracking their diet. It saves the user time by suggesting recipes based on their allergens, goals and favorite product categories. 
The system also allows the user to register available food products manually or by scanning a purchase receipt and sends reminders to the user if any of these products are nearing their expiration date. 
In addition, it can create a shopping list, evaluating the products needed for the diet plan. Finally, system can generate a diet plan upon user request. The plan will take into account a person's weight, height, age, gender, physical activity level, calorie and nutrient needs, goals, allergens, and favorite product categories.

System has integrations of Spoonacular, Api-Ninjas, Vertex AI Gemini application programming interfaces. The server part of the nutrition planning system is implemented in "C#" programming language, using the "ASP .NET Core" framework, "MS SQL Server" for database management and "React" with "Typescript" programming language for the client part.
